\chapter{Summary}
\label{chap:conclusion}


Talk about on future/possible additional ``active learning'' experiment to get feedback.
IGT2P:
1) train on partial tables
2) ask for add'l training instances based on confidence
3) random
4) random forms per table but evenly distributed within tables, same minimum number of forms per table.
\textbf{what the documentation person should do next?}

Implications:
If the presence of POS tags makes a significant difference in the results, then documentary and descriptive linguists may want to re-examine their accepted workflow and emphasize early analysis and labeling of syntactic categories. If the difference is trivial, then linguists would have little reason to allocate early time and funding to POS tagging. NLP practitioners may also want to reconsider their reliance on POS tags for some tasks. 


Intellectual Merit:
more data in linguistics
NLP with field data
NLP with noisy data
NLP with limited, noisy data
NLP with endangered languages
new linguistics field methods
linguistics field methods affect and are affected by theory-based analyses
experimental study of role and reality of POS


Broader Impacts:
methods to speed and improve accessible data
