\chapter{Body of Proposed Dissertation}
\label{chap:body}

This chapter describes three studies that will make up the main body of the proposed dissertation. The studies will address different aspects regarding integration of machine learning into language documentation and description. The first part will investigate the choice of different segmentation strategies and different machine learning models. The second part will identify how different balances of tasks affect integration. The third part looks at the effect of manual cleaning of data on machine learning of inflectional paradigms. Each section describes a supporting pilot study.
